# Sudoku
My sudoku game!

Currently works, need Pygame and Python to run.
Created on Python 3.8 and Pygame 2.0.0.dev6.

Not in proper working order for running, run by moving to Sudoku directory and running main.py.

Need to do some major overhauls in the game file, mainly re-code as a proper Class
  - i didn't really know how Pygame interacts with things
  - make a ton of helpers, clean up code and comments
  
Need to create tons of tests

Need to squish a few bugs
